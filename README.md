# Multiple Linear Regression: Atmospheric CO2 Concentration

**Authors:** Atlanta Liu, Maruthi Mutnuri, Greg Cameron, Edwin Aguirre

**Date:** Fall 2020

Statistical analysis on atmospheric CO2 concentration levels based on worldwide energy consumption, GDP per capita, and global population. One of the major goals of this analysis is to capture the model selection and assumption testing processes involved with linear regressions. The entire project was completed through RStudio.

### Procedure

- Variable Selection
- Assumptions:
  - Linearity
  - Independence
  - Normality
  - Equal Variance
  - Multicolinearity
- Influential Points & Outliers
- Interpreting Coefficients 
- Predicting future atmospheric CO2 levels
